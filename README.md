# Project Name
CLINIQ
    A digital token management system for hospitals and clinics to reduce wait times and enhance patient experience.


## Project Description
CLINIQ is an application designed to transform the traditional patient experience in hospitals and clinics by eliminating the hassle of long waiting times and inefficient token systems. The primary goal of CLINIQ is to provide accurate wait time predictions and virtual queue management, significantly improving patient satisfaction and streamlining operations for healthcare providers.

By digitalizing the token system, CLINIQ enhances the overall hospital management process, allowing patients to book appointments, monitor real-time wait times, and receive instant notifications when their turn approaches. On the other hand, healthcare providers can efficiently manage queues, reschedule appointments, and analyze patient flow data.
